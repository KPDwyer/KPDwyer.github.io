 If you're reading this post and it's mildly relevant, you lived through the same enshittification I have.<br>I'm not old enough to remember the dawn of computing.  But I did have dial-up!  I was a teenager at the exact right time to be a wiz at typing out text messages on a numpad - and being blown away by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T9</a> when it became usable!  As a nerdy, tech loving kiddo that grew up exploring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encarta">Encarta</a>, the internet represented endless opportunity to connect with &amp; learn from others.  We got to grow up in a very singular time:  during the explosion of the internet.</p><p>I believe we are living through another singular time: the collapse of the internet.  This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">not a new or novel concept</a>, but I believe this - subconsiously - is what caused me to pull back from social media back in 2017.  These services were controlled by entities that wanted me to engage with them in a way that was counter to how the services originally presented themselves.  I <em>really did </em>just want to keep a little photo album on the web, not create short-form content to drive engagement so I could sell products via paid promotion.  I <em>really did</em> want to know the passing thoughts of people that interested me,  reaching out to chat about ideas that sparked.  Instead, Twitter was optimised for engagement farming, maximizing the impact users had on the internet as a whole rather than just chatting with the 8 other people who cared about generating mazes</p><blockquote><p>*NOTE: there are way more than 8 people who think about mazes on the internet, trust me*</p></blockquote><p>Anyways, I used to tell people I was "just busy with stuff" - and I was - but now I know I was trying to merely exist on these services.  While these platforms allow for mere existence, the tiny adjustments they make to funnel users into desired behaviours makes it difficult to even be visible on them. And if merely existing on these platforms is inconvenient, why would I even bother?</p><p>Ultimately, I'm slowly moving to federated platforms. <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@KPD">Mastodon</a> replaced Twitter long  ago for me, I'll shift to Pixelfed shortly and nuke my Instagram.  My Facebook is already out of use - I see no reason to replace it.  This year I'll deactivate it, although the amount of people using Messenger gives me pause.  Facebook is the prime example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">The Network Effect</a> for me.  The only thing keeping me there is everyone else.</p><p>Gradually I'll get this site out from under the Microsoft umbrella (hosted on GitHub right now.  I'll likely spin up a Hetzner instance.), and I'll reach a position where even if I rely on (mostly corporate) entities to host the platforms I use, I'll at least have the flexibility to simply leave when they eventually let me down.</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to read.<br><br><br></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on <time datetime="2025-01-26T14:55">Jan 26, 2025</time></div></footer></div></article></main><div class="right-bar"><div class="right-bar__inner"><div class="sidebar"><section class="box featured"><h3 class="box__title">Featured Posts</h3><ul class="featured__container"><li class="featured__item"><div><a href="https://kpdwyer.github.io/social-media.html" class="featured__title">Social Media</a></div></li><li class="featured__item"><a href="https://kpdwyer.github.io/tojam-2024.html" class="featured__image"><img src="https://kpdwyer.github.io/media/posts/7/responsive/5-2-xs.png" loading="lazy" alt="" height="1080" width="1080"></a><div><a href="https://kpdwyer.github.io/tojam-2024.html" class="featured__title">TOJam 2024</a></div></li><li class="featured__item"><a href="https://kpdwyer.github.io/beholdin.html" class="featured__image"><img src="https://kpdwyer.github.io/media/posts/8/beholdin.gif" loading="lazy" alt="" height="250" width="250"></a><div><a href="https://kpdwyer.github.io/beholdin.html" class="featured__title">beholdin&#x27;</a></div></li></ul></section><section class="box tags"><h3 class="box__title">Recommended Topics</h3><ul class="tags__list"><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://kpdwyer.github.io/tags/art/" class="btn btn--gray">art <sup>(4)</sup></a></li><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://kpdwyer.github.io/tags/blender/" class="btn btn--gray">blender <sup>(3)</sup></a></li><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://kpdwyer.github.io/tags/blog/" class="btn btn--gray">blog <sup>(1)</sup></a></li><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://kpdwyer.github.io/tags/experiments/" class="btn btn--gray">experiments <sup>(4)</sup></a></li><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://kpdwyer.github.io/tags/games/" class="btn btn--gray">games <sup>(1)</sup></a></li><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://kpdwyer.github.io/tags/godot/" class="btn btn--gray">godot <sup>(3)</sup></a></li><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://kpdwyer.github.io/tags/inktober/" class="btn btn--gray">inktober <sup>(1)</sup></a></li><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://kpdwyer.github.io/tags/jams/" class="btn btn--gray">jams <sup>(1)</sup></a></li><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://kpdwyer.github.io/tags/krita/" class="btn btn--gray">krita <sup>(1)</sup></a></li><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://kpdwyer.github.io/tags/meta/" class="btn btn--gray">meta <sup>(1)</sup></a></li></ul></section></div></div></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://kpdwyer.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=b2d91bcadbf5db401b76eb5bb3092eb7"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
